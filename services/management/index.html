                <p>We normally work at a senior level giving expert guidance to the owners and departmental heads. Owners of small companies generally feel that they are very lonely at the top. They frequently don’t have anyone with whom they can discuss strategies and issues. Your CFO support is just as a good sounding board for the owners. Like an online partner. We have a wealth of experience, which a company owners can tap tap into:</p>

                     Operating a growing business without a growth plan can be risky. The likelihood of success is much higher if there is a plan for when the business needs to add cash, people, training, knowledge, capacity, distribution channels, and more. We can help you create your plan and follow it.

                      We will take of your vision of your company’s future and turn it into a meaningful financial projection. It will tell you if you should expect to have excess cash or there will be shortfall of cash & whether you will be requiring cash. If you require cash to grow, we will prepare cash flow projections, which will show your bank your position so they can analyze and lend money. It will also help you plan when you will need to hire more people and add more equipment and/or facilities. Normally financial projections are part of the answers for a business owner for the majority of the problems which they face in the various business scenarios.

                     All businesses have key factors. If we monitor this key factors properly it gives an indication of how the business is doing. Key indicators can tell you what is happening today and can sometimes predict what will happen in the future. We may find key factors in production, distribution, overtime statistics, sales operations, order taking, cash collections, inventory levels, backlog statistics, or other areas depending on the type of business you are in. We can identify these factors and set up a process for tracking and analyzing them.

                      As businesses grow and change, their organizational structure frequently evolves into one that is less than optimum. The business may have become one that has misallocations of resources. It may not function like the well-oiled machine it once was. We can look at your business objectively, help you visualize your optimum structure, and create a plan to implement the changes that you decide you want to make.
                      Also we can manage the staff members onsite which may allow the business owners to focus on other aspects of the business rather than spending time managing the accounting function. We will identify staff members who are in the wrong job, and we can help find suitable replacements. We also recommend incentive plans for them.
